In object-oriented programming, the static keyword is used to define a static method or property for a class rather than an instance of the class. Here's what it means for methods and properties:

Static Methods:

A static method is a method that belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
Static methods are called on the class itself, not on an instance of the class.
They are defined using the static keyword before the method name.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
class MyClass {
static myStaticMethod() {
console.log("This is a static method.");
}
}

// Call the static method without creating an instance
MyClass.myStaticMethod();
Static Properties:

Similarly, a static property is a property that belongs to the class itself, not to instances of the class.
Static properties are shared among all instances of the class.
They are also defined using the static keyword.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
class MyClass {
static myStaticProperty = "I am a static property";
}

// Access the static property without creating an instance
console.log(MyClass.myStaticProperty);
In your provided code:

javascript
Copy code
class ProductModel {
// ... (constructor and other instance methods)

    static get() {
        return products;
    }

}
The static get() method is a static method. It can be called on the class itself (ProductModel.get()) rather than on an instance of ProductModel. In this case, it's used to retrieve a pre-defined array of products. The use of static makes sense when the method is not dependent on the specific instance state and can be shared among all instances of the class.

if static was not there then how it was called

If the static keyword was not used, the method would be an instance method, and you would need to create an instance of the class before calling the method. Here's how the code might look without the static keyword:

class ProductModel {
constructor(\_id, \_name, \_desc, \_price, \_imageUrl) {
this.id = \_id;
this.name = \_name;
this.desc = \_desc;
this.price = \_price;
this.imageUrl = \_imageUrl;
}

    // Instance method to get products (not static)
    get() {
        return products;
    }

}

// Example usage:
const productInstance = new ProductModel(/_..._/);
const products = productInstance.get();

In our project we uses static get()
but in this we used it without static so here it is without using static

In this case, you would need to create an instance of ProductModel using the new keyword, and then you could call the get() method on that instance. Each instance would have its own copy of the get() method, and the method might have access to the instance's properties.

However, in the original code you provided, the static keyword is used for the get() method, making it a method of the class itself rather than an instance of the class. This allows you to call ProductModel.get() directly without creating an instance of ProductModel. The use of static is appropriate here because the method seems to be concerned with retrieving a common set of data that is not dependent on any specific instance's state.
