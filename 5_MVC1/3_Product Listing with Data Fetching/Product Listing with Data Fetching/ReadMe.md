Product Model

In this code snippet from the ProductModel class, you are importing the products array from the "../assets/products.js" file, and then defining a method fetchProducts that returns this array. Let me break it down:

// ProductModel
import { products } from "../assets/products.js";

export default class ProductModel {
  // Define a method named fetchProducts
  fetchProducts = () => {
    // Return the imported products array
    return products;
  };
}

Explanation:

Import Statement:

import { products } from "../assets/products.js";: This statement imports the products array from the "../assets/products.js" file. It assumes that the "products.js" file exports an object with a products property containing an array of product data.
Class Definition:

export default class ProductModel { ... }: This line defines a class named ProductModel and exports it as the default export from the module.
Method Definition:

fetchProducts = () => { return products; };: This defines a method named fetchProducts as an arrow function. The purpose of this method is to fetch and return the products array.
So, when you create an instance of ProductModel in your ProductController and call the fetchProducts method, it returns the array of products, which can then be used in your application logic, such as rendering the product details in a table.


// ProductController

In the provided code for ProductController, you are implementing the getProducts method. Let me break down what each part of the code does

// ProductController
import ProductModel from "../models/product.model.js";

export default class ProductController {
  // Define a method named getProducts
  getProducts = (req, res) => {
    // Create an instance of ProductModel
    const productModel = new ProductModel();
    
    // Fetch products by calling the fetchProducts method on the productModel instance
    const products = productModel.fetchProducts();
    
    // Render the "product" view (assumed to be an EJS template)
    // and pass the fetched products as data to be used in the view
    res.render("product", { products });
  };
}


Explanation:

Import Statement:

import ProductModel from "../models/product.model.js";: This line imports the ProductModel class from the "../models/product.model.js" file. This assumes that ProductModel is a class definition in the specified file.
Class Definition:

export default class ProductController { ... }: This line defines a class named ProductController and exports it as the default export from the module.
Method Definition:

getProducts = (req, res) => { ... }: This defines a method named getProducts as an arrow function. The purpose of this method is to handle a request (req) and send a response (res). It is commonly used in web applications to handle requests and render views.
Instance Creation:

const productModel = new ProductModel();: This line creates an instance of the ProductModel class. This instance is used to interact with the methods and properties of the ProductModel class.
Fetch Products:

const products = productModel.fetchProducts();: This line calls the fetchProducts method on the productModel instance, which, in turn, fetches the products (likely an array of products) from a data source. The fetched products are stored in the products variable.
Render View:

res.render("product", { products });: This line renders a view named "product" (assuming it's an EJS template) and passes the fetched products as data to be used within the view. The second argument to res.render is an object containing the data to be passed to the view.
In summary, the getProducts method is responsible for fetching product data using the ProductModel class and rendering the "product" view with the fetched products.
